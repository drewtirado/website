# Task ID: 27
# Title: Confirm CMS Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24
# Priority: high
# Description: Verify that the Netlify CMS is properly secured and only authorized users can access and modify content.
# Details:
1. Configure Netlify Identity for authentication:
```toml
# netlify.toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

# Protect the admin area
[[redirects]]
  from = "/admin/*"
  to = "/admin/index.html"
  status = 200
  conditions = {Role = ["admin"]}
```

2. Set up role-based access control in Netlify Identity:
   - Log in to the Netlify dashboard
   - Go to Site settings > Identity > Registration
   - Set registration preferences to "Invite only"
   - Under Identity > Services, enable Git Gateway

3. Configure the CMS to use Netlify Identity:
```yaml
# public/admin/config.yml
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: main
  identity_url: "https://yoursite.netlify.app/.netlify/identity"
  gateway_url: "https://yoursite.netlify.app/.netlify/git"
  repo: username/repo # GitHub username and repository

publish_mode: editorial_workflow # Optional: adds an approval workflow

media_folder: "public/images/uploads"
public_folder: "/images/uploads"

# Collections configuration...
```

4. Add user management in the Netlify dashboard:
   - Go to Identity > Invite users
   - Enter email addresses of authorized users
   - Assign appropriate roles (admin, editor, etc.)

5. Implement content validation in the CMS:
```yaml
# Example of field validation in config.yml
fields:
  - label: "Title"
    name: "title"
    widget: "string"
    pattern: ['.{3,}', "Title must be at least 3 characters"]
  - label: "Email"
    name: "email"
    widget: "string"
    pattern: ['^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$', "Must be a valid email address"]
```

6. Set up media library security:
```yaml
# Restrict media uploads by file type and size
media_library:
  max_file_size: 512000 # 500KB
  allowed_extensions: ["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "webp"]
```

7. Configure the Netlify Identity widget in the admin page:
```html
<!-- public/admin/index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Content Manager</title>
    <script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
    <script>
      if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
        window.netlifyIdentity.on("init", user => {
          if (!user) {
            window.netlifyIdentity.on("login", () => {
              document.location.href = "/admin/";
            });
          }
        });
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

8. Add HTTP security headers in Netlify configuration:
```toml
# Add security headers
[[headers]]
  for = "/*"
  [headers.values]
    X-Frame-Options = "DENY"
    X-XSS-Protection = "1; mode=block"
    X-Content-Type-Options = "nosniff"
    Referrer-Policy = "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
    Content-Security-Policy = "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://identity.netlify.com https://unpkg.com; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https://res.cloudinary.com; connect-src 'self' https://api.netlify.com;"
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that unauthenticated users cannot access the CMS admin area
2. Test login functionality with valid and invalid credentials
3. Confirm that users with different roles have appropriate access levels
4. Test content validation rules to ensure they prevent invalid data
5. Verify that media uploads are restricted to allowed file types and sizes
6. Test the editorial workflow if enabled (draft, review, publish)
7. Check that security headers are properly set
8. Verify that the Git Gateway is correctly configured
9. Test password reset functionality
10. Verify that session timeout works correctly
