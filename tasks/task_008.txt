# Task ID: 8
# Title: Netlify CMS Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Netlify CMS for content management with Git-based storage and Netlify Identity for authentication.
# Details:
1. Install Netlify CMS: `npm install netlify-cms-app`
2. Create an admin folder in the public directory with `index.html` and `config.yml`

<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

# Test Strategy:
1. Test Netlify Identity authentication
2. Verify that all collections are correctly configured
3. Test creating, updating, and deleting content for each collection
4. Confirm that media uploads work correctly
5. Verify that changes in the CMS are correctly reflected in the site after rebuilding

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Initialize Netlify CMS [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install Netlify CMS and set up the admin interface in the public directory.
### Details:
Run `npm install netlify-cms-app`. Create a `public/admin` folder containing `index.html` and `config.yml` to initialize the CMS interface.
<info added on 2025-05-04T00:08:59.545Z>
Run `npm install netlify-cms-app`. Create a `public/admin` folder containing `index.html` and `config.yml` to initialize the CMS interface.

Encountered React version incompatibility issue: Project uses React 19, while netlify-cms-app requires React 16/17. Switching to `decap-cms-app`, which is the community-maintained fork of Netlify CMS with potentially better compatibility with newer React versions. Will install using `npm install decap-cms-app` instead. The setup process remains similar - creating the `public/admin` folder with `index.html` and `config.yml`, but will update imports and configuration to use decap-cms instead of netlify-cms.
</info added on 2025-05-04T00:08:59.545Z>
<info added on 2025-05-04T00:09:16.693Z>
The installation of `decap-cms-app` also encountered React version incompatibility issues. The package requires React 18, but our project is using React 19. As a workaround, we'll attempt to install the package using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag: `npm install decap-cms-app --legacy-peer-deps`. 

This approach bypasses peer dependency checks, which could potentially lead to runtime issues, but it's worth trying as a next step. If successful, we'll proceed with creating the `public/admin` folder containing `index.html` and `config.yml` files to initialize the CMS interface. If this approach fails or causes runtime issues, we may need to consider downgrading React or exploring alternative CMS solutions that are compatible with React 19.

The installation of `decap-cms-app` was successful using the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag, which allowed us to bypass the React version compatibility issues. 

Created the required directory structure in `public/admin/` with two key files:

1. `index.html` - Set up with the proper HTML structure including:
   - The necessary DOCTYPE and HTML tags
   - Required meta tags in the head section
   - Script tags for loading the Netlify Identity widget
   - Script tags for loading the Decap CMS UMD bundle

2. `config.yml` - Created as an empty placeholder file that will be configured in the next subtask when setting up Netlify Identity and Git Gateway.

The admin interface structure is now in place, ready for configuration in the next step. The use of the UMD bundle approach should help avoid further React version compatibility issues since it loads Decap CMS as a standalone script rather than as a React component.

## 2. Configure Netlify Identity and Git Gateway [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Enable Netlify Identity and Git Gateway for authentication and Git-based content management.
### Details:
In the Netlify UI, go to Site configuration > Identity and enable Identity. Under Services, enable Git Gateway. Adjust registration settings and external providers as needed.[1][5]

## 3. Define Content Collections and Fields in config.yml [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Set up collections and fields for all content types in the CMS configuration file.
### Details:
Edit `public/admin/config.yml` to define collections for Home, Work, Journal, Shop, and Info, specifying fields and data structures as required.
<info added on 2025-05-22T03:21:38.153Z>
Defined content collections in `public/admin/config.yml` with the following structure:
- Home and Info: File-based collections pointing to JSON files
- Work, Journal, and Shop: Folder-based collections supporting multiple entries

Each collection includes custom fields aligned with the project requirements for managing dynamic content through Netlify CMS. The configuration enables content editors to manage all website sections through the admin interface.

## 4. Set Up Media and Public Folders [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3

## 7. Implement preview template for 'Home' collection [done]
### Dependencies: 8.6
### Description: Develop the React component for the 'Home' collection preview and register it.
### Details:
In `src/cms-previews.jsx`, create a React component `HomePreview` that takes entry data and renders a basic preview for the home page images. Register this component using `CMS.registerPreviewTemplate('home', HomePreview);`.
<info added on 2025-05-22T03:29:00.326Z>
I've implemented the HomePreview component in src/cms-previews.jsx that renders a preview of the images selected for the Home collection. The component successfully extracts image data from the CMS entry and displays it in a format similar to the actual home page. I've registered this preview template with Decap CMS using CMS.registerPreviewTemplate('home', HomePreview); and verified it's working correctly in the CMS interface.

<info added on 2025-05-22T03:29:32.517Z>
Implemented the `JournalPreview` React component in `src/cms-previews.jsx`. The component renders journal entries with conditional logic to handle different content types (text, image, poem), displaying the appropriate fields for each type. Each preview includes the entry title, date, type indicator, and formatted content based on the entry type. Successfully registered the component with Decap CMS using `CMS.registerPreviewTemplate('journal', JournalPreview);`.
