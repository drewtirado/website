Adjust spacing between navigation items to work better in a vertical layout (increase vertical margins, reduce horizontal margins)\n3. Update the positioning of the .work-subnav dropdown to appear to the right of the Work button instead of below it\n4. Set position: relative on the parent li containing the Work button\n5.

Create Layout.module.css:\n   - Add styles for the main content container\n   - Apply left padding or margin equal to the navigation width to prevent content overlap\n   - Ensure the main content takes up the remaining viewport width\n\n3. Update Layout.jsx:\n   - Import the new Layout.module.css\n   - Apply the appropriate class names to the main content container\n   - Ensure the navigation component remains outside this container\n\n4. Modify index.css:\n   - Remove `display: flex` and `place-items: center` from the body element\n   - Update any other global styles that might conflict with the fixed navigation\n\nThis approach creates a fixed sidebar navigation that remains visible as users scroll through the page content, with the main content appropriately offset to prevent overlap.\n</info added on 2025-05-03T22:45:20.501Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-03T22:51:40.504Z>\nCreate Navigation.module.css.

Remove the absolute positioning from the `.workSubnav` element\n2. Remove the relative positioning from the `.workNavItem` container\n3.
