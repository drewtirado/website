# Task ID: 16
# Title: Initialize Vite React Project
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial project structure using Vite and React, configure essential dependencies and project architecture.
# Details:
1. Install Node.js and npm if not already installed
2. Create a new Vite project with React template: `npm create vite@latest photographer-portfolio -- --template react`
3. Navigate to project directory: `cd photographer-portfolio`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Set up project structure:
   - `/src/components/` - For reusable UI components
   - `/src/pages/` - For page components (Home, Work, Journal, Shop, Info)
   - `/src/assets/` - For static assets
   - `/src/styles/` - For CSS/SCSS files
6. Configure routing using React Router: `npm install react-router-dom`
7. Set up basic routing in App.jsx
8. Create a basic layout component with header and navigation
9. Test the setup with `npm run dev`

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the project builds without errors
2. Confirm that the development server starts correctly
3. Check that routing works by navigating to different placeholder pages
4. Ensure the project structure follows best practices for React applications

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install Prerequisites and Initialize Vite React Project [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure Node.js and npm are installed, then create a new Vite project using the React template.
### Details:
Verify Node.js and npm installation. Run `npm create vite@latest photographer-portfolio -- --template react` to scaffold the project.
<info added on 2025-05-22T03:37:41.410Z>
Prerequisites (Node.js and npm) have been confirmed as installed. The Vite + React project has already been initialized with the name `drew-tirado-website`, so the step to create a new Vite project using `npm create vite@latest` is no longer needed. We can proceed directly to the next subtask for installing project dependencies.

## 2. Install Project Dependencies [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Navigate to the project directory and install all required dependencies.
### Details:
Change directory to `photographer-portfolio` and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
<info added on 2025-05-22T03:38:01.558Z>
Ran `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install project dependencies, bypassing peer dependency conflicts primarily related to React version mismatches with `decap-cms-app` and its sub-dependencies. The installation completed successfully with this flag.

## 3. Establish Project Directory Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Set up the recommended folder structure for components, pages, assets, and styles.
### Details:
Create `/src/components/`, `/src/pages/`, `/src/assets/`, and `/src/styles/` directories following best practices for React and Vite projects[1][2][3].
<info added on 2025-05-22T03:38:13.538Z>
I've verified the project directory structure within `src/`. The structure includes all required folders: `components/`, `pages/`, `assets/`, `styles/`, as well as additional organizational folders `data/` and `context/`. This structure aligns with modern React project organization best practices and satisfies the requirements outlined in this subtask.

## 4. Configure Routing and Layout [done]
### Dependencies: 16.3
### Description: Install React Router and set up basic routing and a layout component with navigation.
### Details:
Install `react-router-dom`, configure routes in `App.jsx`, and create a layout component with header and navigation links.
<info added on 2025-05-22T03:38:31.953Z>
Verified that `react-router-dom` is installed and configured. `src/main.jsx` correctly uses `<BrowserRouter>`, and `src/App.jsx` defines routes using `<Routes>` and `<Route>`, including a main `<Layout />`. This aligns with the requirements of the subtask and previous work done on routing (Task 5).

## 5. Verify Project Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 16.4
### Description: Test the development server to ensure the project runs and the initial structure is functional.
### Details:
Run `npm run dev` and confirm the app loads with the basic layout and routing in place.
<info added on 2025-05-22T03:50:54.040Z>
Successfully started the Vite development server using `npm run dev` after a clean reinstall of dependencies. The application loads correctly in the browser with the basic layout and routing functioning as expected. Previously encountered module resolution errors related to `ajv` and `slate-hyperscript` packages have been resolved.
