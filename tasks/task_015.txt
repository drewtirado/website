# Task ID: 15
# Title: Testing and Quality Assurance
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive testing and quality assurance for the website.
# Details:
1. Set up testing framework: `npm install vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom`
2. Create unit tests for components
3. Implement integration tests for page functionality
4. Set up end-to-end testing with Cypress
5. Create test fixtures for data
6. Example test for the Home page:
```jsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import HomePage from '../src/pages/HomePage';

// Mock fetch for data loading
global.fetch = vi.fn();

describe('HomePage', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    fetch.mockResolvedValue({
      ok: true,
      json: async () => ([
        '/images/home/image1.jpg',
        '/images/home/image2.jpg',
        '/images/home/image3.jpg',
        '/images/home/image4.jpg'
      ])
    });
  });
  
  it('renders two images on load', async () => {
    render(<HomePage />);
    
    // Wait for images to load
    const images = await screen.findAllByRole('img');
    expect(images).toHaveLength(2);
  });
  
  it('swaps image when clicked', async () => {
    render(<HomePage />);
    
    // Wait for images to load
    const initialImages = await screen.findAllByRole('img');
    const firstImageSrc = initialImages[0].src;
    
    // Click the first image
    fireEvent.click(initialImages[0]);
    
    // Get updated images
    const updatedImages = await screen.findAllByRole('img');
    expect(updatedImages[0].src).not.toEqual(firstImageSrc);
  });
});
```
7. Set up GitHub Actions or other CI/CD for automated testing
8. Implement performance testing with Lighthouse
9. Create a pre-deployment checklist

# Test Strategy:
1. Run unit tests for all components
2. Execute integration tests for page functionality
3. Perform end-to-end testing with Cypress
4. Run accessibility tests
5. Conduct performance testing with Lighthouse
6. Test on different browsers and devices
7. Verify that all requirements from the PRD are met

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Testing Framework and Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the necessary testing frameworks and tools for the project, including Vitest, React Testing Library, Jest DOM, and jsdom for browser-like testing environments.
### Details:
Run `npm install vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom global-jsdom` and configure the test environment to use jsdom for simulating browser APIs, ensuring compatibility with React Testing Library and Vitest.

## 2. Develop Unit and Integration Tests for Components and Pages [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create comprehensive unit tests for individual React components and integration tests for page-level functionality, ensuring all logic and UI behaviors are covered.
### Details:
Write tests using React Testing Library and Vitest for components and pages, including scenarios such as rendering, user interactions, and data loading. Use mock data and functions where necessary.

## 3. Implement End-to-End Testing with Cypress [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing to simulate real user interactions and verify complete workflows across the website.
### Details:
Install Cypress, configure it for the project, and write E2E tests that cover navigation, form submissions, and critical user journeys.

## 4. Integrate Automated Testing into CI/CD Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Configure GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool to automatically run all tests on each push or pull request, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.
### Details:
Set up workflows to execute unit, integration, and E2E tests, and report results. Ensure the pipeline fails on test failures and provides clear feedback.

## 5. Conduct Performance Testing and Final Quality Assurance [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Use Lighthouse and a pre-deployment checklist to assess website performance, accessibility, and overall quality before release.
### Details:
Run Lighthouse audits, review test coverage, validate accessibility, and complete a checklist covering all QA criteria prior to deployment.
