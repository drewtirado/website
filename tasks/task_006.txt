# Task ID: 6
# Title: Shop Page Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Shop page with separate sections for Open Edition and Limited Edition prints, displaying all required information for each print.
# Details:
1. Create a `ShopPage.jsx` component in the pages folder
2. Set up data structure for shop items in `/src/data/shopItems.json`
3. Separate items into Open Edition and Limited Edition sections
4. Display all required information for each print (title, image, description, edition, price, availability)
5. Style the page to match the minimal design aesthetic
6. Example implementation:
```jsx
const ShopPage = () => {
  const [shopItems, setShopItems] = useState({
    openEdition: [],
    limitedEdition: []
  });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/src/data/shopItems.json')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => {
        // Separate items by edition type
        const openEdition = data.filter(item => item.edition === 'open');
        const limitedEdition = data.filter(item => item.edition === 'limited');
        setShopItems({ openEdition, limitedEdition });
      });
  }, []);
  
  const renderPrint = (print) => (
    <div key={print.id} className="shop-item">
      <img src={print.image} alt={print.title} className="shop-item-image" />
      <h3>{print.title}</h3>
      <p className="shop-item-description">{print.description}</p>
      <div className="shop-item-details">
        <p className="shop-item-edition">
          {print.edition === 'limited' ? `Limited Edition (${print.available}/${print.total})` : 'Open Edition'}
        </p>
        <p className="shop-item-price">${print.price}</p>
        <p className="shop-item-availability">
          {print.available > 0 ? 'Available' : 'Sold Out'}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
  
  return (
    <div className="shop-page">
      <section className="shop-section">
        <h2>Open Edition Prints</h2>
        <div className="shop-items-grid">
          {shopItems.openEdition.map(renderPrint)}
        </div>
      </section>
      
      <section className="shop-section">
        <h2>Limited Edition Prints</h2>
        <div className="shop-items-grid">
          {shopItems.limitedEdition.map(renderPrint)}
        </div>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that prints are correctly categorized into Open Edition and Limited Edition sections
2. Test that all required information is displayed for each print
3. Confirm that availability status is correctly shown
4. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes
5. Verify image loading performance

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Shop Data Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and organize the shop items data in a JSON file, ensuring each print includes all required fields (title, image, description, edition, price, availability, etc.).
### Details:
Define the schema for shop items in `/src/data/shopItems.json` and populate it with sample data for both Open Edition and Limited Edition prints.
<info added on 2025-05-03T23:43:39.171Z>
Create a new file at `public/data/shopItems.json` to store all shop item data. Structure the file as a JSON array containing multiple item objects. Each item object should follow this schema:

- `id`: Unique string identifier for each product
- `title`: Name of the art print
- `image`: Path to the product image (relative to public directory)
- `description`: Detailed description of the artwork
- `edition`: Type of print, either "open" or "limited"
- `price`: Numerical price in USD (without currency symbol)
- `available`: Number of prints currently available for purchase
- `total`: Total number of prints in edition (required for limited editions only)

Populate the file with 3-4 placeholder entries that include both open edition and limited edition prints to demonstrate the structure. This data will be consumed by the ShopPage component in the next subtask.

<info added on 2025-05-03T23:48:04.078Z>
The `public/data/shopItems.json` file has been successfully created and populated with sample data according to the specified schema. The file includes a total of 4 placeholder entries - 2 open edition prints and 2 limited edition prints. Each item contains all the required fields: id, title, image, description, edition, price, available, and total (for limited editions). This data structure will serve as the foundation for the shop page implementation and will be consumed by the ShopPage component in the next subtask.

## 2. Develop ShopPage Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create the `ShopPage.jsx` component and set up the basic layout for the shop page.
### Details:
Implement the main container and section headers for Open Edition and Limited Edition prints within the component.
<info added on 2025-05-03T23:48:43.458Z>
The ShopPage component has been created in the src/pages/ directory. The component implements a main container div with two distinct section elements. Each section contains an h2 header, one for 'Open Edition Prints' and another for 'Limited Edition Prints'. Placeholder comments have been added where the item grids will be implemented. This structure provides the foundation for the next subtask which will involve fetching and separating shop items by edition type.

## 3. Fetch and Separate Shop Items by Edition [done]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement logic in `ShopPage.jsx` to fetch shop items from the JSON file and categorize them into Open Edition and Limited Edition sections.
### Details:
Use React hooks to load data and filter items based on their edition type, storing them in state variables.
<info added on 2025-05-03T23:49:58.350Z>
Use React hooks to load data and filter items based on their edition type, storing them in state variables.

The implementation uses useState to create two state variables: openEdition and limitedEdition to store the respective shop items. A useEffect hook is responsible for fetching data from '/data/shopItems.json'. The hook includes error handling for the fetch operation and validates that the response is an array. Once data is retrieved, it filters the items based on their 'edition' property and updates the component state accordingly. The empty dependency array ensures the fetch operation runs only once when the component mounts.

## 4. Display Print Information [done]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Render all required information for each print, including title, image, description, edition, price, and availability.
### Details:
Map over the separated items and display their details in a visually organized manner within each section.
<info added on 2025-05-03T23:50:17.945Z>
Map over the separated items and display their details in a visually organized manner within each section.

Created a `renderPrint` helper function within `ShopPage.jsx` that generates the JSX for a single shop item. This function handles the display of:
- Print image
- Title
- Description
- Edition details (including count for limited editions)
- Formatted price
- Availability status

Implemented the rendering logic for both sections by replacing placeholder comments with:
- `shopItems.openEdition.map(renderPrint)` for Open Edition prints
- `shopItems.limitedEdition.map(renderPrint)` for Limited Edition prints

Added conditional rendering to display appropriate messages when no prints are available in a section, improving the user experience.

## 5. Apply Minimal Design Styling [done]
### Dependencies: 6.4
### Description: Style the Shop page and its components to match the minimal design aesthetic.
### Details:
Use CSS or a styling solution to ensure the layout, typography, and spacing are clean and minimal.
<info added on 2025-05-03T23:50:38.884Z>
Use CSS or a styling solution to ensure the layout, typography, and spacing are clean and minimal. CSS styles have been added to `src/index.css` for the Shop page elements. This includes specific styles for the following classes:
- `.shop-page`: Main container styling
- `.shop-section`: Section containers within the shop page
- `.shop-items-grid`: Responsive grid layout for displaying shop items
- `.shop-item`: Individual item card styling
- `.shop-item-image`: Image container and sizing
- `.shop-item-details`: Text information styling

The implemented styles establish a basic responsive grid layout with minimal borders, appropriate padding and margins, and typography that maintains a clean, minimal aesthetic. These styles ensure the shop page maintains visual consistency with the rest of the application's minimal design approach.
