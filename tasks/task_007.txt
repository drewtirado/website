# Task ID: 7
# Title: Info Page Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the Info page displaying the photographer's bio, informal CV, and contact email.
# Details:
1. Create an `InfoPage.jsx` component in the pages folder
2. Set up data structure for info content in `/src/data/info.json`
3. Display bio, CV, and email in a clean, minimal layout
4. Style the page to match the overall design aesthetic
5. Implement secure email display (optional: obfuscation or contact form)
6. Example implementation:
```jsx
const InfoPage = () => {
  const [info, setInfo] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/src/data/info.json')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setInfo(data));
  }, []);
  
  if (!info) return <div>Loading...</div>;
  
  return (
    <div className="info-page">
      <section className="bio-section">
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: info.bio }} />
      </section>
      
      <section className="cv-section">
        <h2>CV</h2>
        <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: info.cv }} />
      </section>
      
      <section className="contact-section">
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>
          <a href={`mailto:${info.email}`}>{info.email}</a>
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that all sections (bio, CV, email) are displayed correctly
2. Test that HTML content renders properly
3. Confirm that the email link works correctly
4. Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Info Page Data Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and create a structured JSON file to hold the photographer's bio, CV, and contact email.
### Details:
Create `/src/data/info.json` with fields for bio, CV, and email. Ensure the structure supports easy updates and rendering.

Create `/src/data/info.json` with fields for bio, CV, and email. Ensure the structure supports easy updates and rendering.

The file has been created at `public/data/info.json` instead of the originally planned location. The JSON structure includes:
- `bio` field containing HTML-formatted paragraphs for the photographer's biography
- `cv` field with HTML formatting for headings, lists, and paragraphs to display the curriculum vitae
- `email` field as a simple string for contact information

This structure allows for direct rendering of formatted text in the InfoPage component while maintaining easy content updates. The HTML string approach enables rich text formatting without requiring a complex editor or parser.

## 2. Implement InfoPage Component [done]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Develop the `InfoPage.jsx` React component to fetch and display the info content.
### Details:
Use React hooks to fetch data from `/src/data/info.json` and render the bio, CV, and email sections using JSX.
<info added on 2025-05-04T00:03:04.214Z>
The InfoPage component has been created at `src/pages/InfoPage.jsx` with the following implementation:

1. State management:
   - Added state for `info` to store the fetched data
   - Added `loading` state to track data fetching status
   - Added `error` state to handle potential fetch errors

2. Data fetching:
   - Implemented a `useEffect` hook that runs on component mount
   - Fetches data from `/data/info.json`
   - Updates the appropriate state variables based on fetch results

3. Conditional rendering:
   - Added logic to display loading indicator while data is being fetched
   - Implemented error handling to show error messages when fetch fails
   - Currently using a `<pre>` tag to display raw JSON data for verification purposes

4. Routing:
   - Added the import for InfoPage component in `src/App.jsx`
   - Configured a route for `/info` path to render the InfoPage component

Next steps:
- Replace the temporary `<pre>` tag with proper UI components
- Structure the fetched data into bio, CV, and email sections as specified
- Style the component according to design requirements

## 3. Layout and Structure Content [done]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Organize the InfoPage layout to present the bio, CV, and contact email in a clean, minimal format.
### Details:
Structure the JSX into clearly separated sections for biography, CV, and contact, ensuring semantic HTML and accessibility.
<info added on 2025-05-04T00:03:25.031Z>
Structure the JSX into clearly separated sections for biography, CV, and contact, ensuring semantic HTML and accessibility.

The InfoPage component has been structured with semantic HTML using section elements:
- Created three main sections with appropriate class names: 'info-section', 'bio-section', 'cv-section', and 'contact-section'
- Each section includes an h2 heading for proper document outline and accessibility
- Implemented dangerouslySetInnerHTML to render the fetched HTML content for bio and CV sections
- Created a clickable mailto: link for the email address in the contact section
- Removed temporary pre tags used during initial development

## 4. Apply Styling to Match Design Aesthetic [done]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Style the InfoPage component to ensure visual consistency with the overall site design.
### Details:
Use CSS modules or styled-components to apply minimal, cohesive styles that align with the site's branding.
<info added on 2025-05-04T00:03:48.786Z>
Use CSS modules or styled-components to apply minimal, cohesive styles that align with the site's branding. 

CSS styles have been implemented in src/index.css for the Info Page component. The implementation includes:

1. Base container styles:
   - .info-page: Applied padding, max-width, and margins for proper layout
   - .info-section: Set appropriate spacing and structure

2. Typography styling:
   - Added specific h2 styles within sections for consistent headings
   - Implemented typography rules for content rendered via dangerouslySetInnerHTML
   - Styled p, ul, li, and h3 elements within .info-section div to maintain consistent spacing and readability

3. Interactive elements:
   - Applied specific styling to .contact-section a for proper link presentation

The styling approach uses global CSS in index.css rather than CSS modules or styled-components as initially planned, but maintains the minimal, cohesive aesthetic that aligns with the site's branding.

## 5. Implement Secure Email Display [done]
### Dependencies: 7.4
### Description: Add security measures for displaying the contact email, such as obfuscation or a contact form.
### Details:
Choose and implement an approach to protect the email from bots, such as JavaScript obfuscation or replacing with a contact form.
<info added on 2025-05-04T00:04:18.606Z>
Choose and implement an approach to protect the email from bots, such as JavaScript obfuscation or replacing with a contact form.

The email obfuscation has been implemented using a client-side rendering approach. A new component `src/components/EmailLink/EmailLink.jsx` was created that:
- Takes `user` and `domain` props to separate the email address parts
- Uses React's `useEffect` hook to construct the full email address only on the client side
- Builds the `mailto:` link dynamically after the component mounts

The `InfoPage.jsx` component was updated to:
- Import the new `EmailLink` component
- Parse the email address from the fetched `info` data into user and domain parts
- Replace the direct `mailto:` link with the `EmailLink` component in the contact section

This approach prevents email address scraping by bots that analyze static HTML, as the complete email address is never present in the source code.
