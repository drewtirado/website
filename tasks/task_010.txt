# Task ID: 10
# Title: Image Optimization and Lazy Loading
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement image optimization and lazy loading for better performance.
# Details:
1. Install necessary packages: `npm install react-lazy-load-image-component`
2. Create a custom Image component that supports lazy loading
3. Implement responsive image sizes using srcset
4. Add blur-up loading effect for better user experience
5. Optimize images during build process
6. Example implementation:
```jsx
import { LazyLoadImage } from 'react-lazy-load-image-component';
import 'react-lazy-load-image-component/src/effects/blur.css';

const OptimizedImage = ({ src, alt, className, onClick }) => {
  // Generate srcset for responsive images
  const generateSrcSet = (imagePath) => {
    // This is a simplified example. In a real app, you would have different sized images.
    const basePath = imagePath.substring(0, imagePath.lastIndexOf('.'));
    const extension = imagePath.substring(imagePath.lastIndexOf('.'));
    return `
      ${basePath}-small${extension} 500w,
      ${basePath}-medium${extension} 1000w,
      ${imagePath} 1500w
    `;
  };
  
  return (
    <LazyLoadImage
      src={src}
      alt={alt}
      effect="blur"
      className={className}
      onClick={onClick}
      srcSet={generateSrcSet(src)}
      sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
      threshold={100}
      placeholder={<div className="image-placeholder" />}
    />
  );
};

export default OptimizedImage;
```
7. Replace all image tags with the OptimizedImage component
8. Set up a build step to generate different image sizes (can use tools like sharp)

# Test Strategy:
1. Test image loading performance
2. Verify that lazy loading works correctly
3. Test responsive image loading on different devices
4. Measure performance improvements (e.g., using Lighthouse)
5. Verify that the blur-up effect works correctly

# Subtasks:
## 1. Install and Configure Lazy Loading Library [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install the 'react-lazy-load-image-component' package and configure it in the project to enable lazy loading for images.
### Details:
Run 'npm install react-lazy-load-image-component' and ensure the package is properly added to the project dependencies. Import the necessary CSS for blur effects.

## 2. Develop Custom Optimized Image Component [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create a reusable React component that wraps LazyLoadImage, supporting props for src, alt, className, onClick, and responsive image handling.
### Details:
Implement the OptimizedImage component to accept image props, generate srcSet for responsive images, and apply the blur-up effect using the library's 'effect' prop.

## 3. Implement Responsive Image Sizing with srcSet [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Enhance the custom image component to generate and use srcSet and sizes attributes for responsive image loading.
### Details:
Add logic to the component to generate srcSet strings for different image resolutions and set appropriate sizes for various viewport widths.

## 4. Automate Image Optimization During Build [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Set up a build process (e.g., using Sharp) to generate multiple optimized image sizes for use with srcSet.
### Details:
Integrate an image processing tool into the build pipeline to output small, medium, and large versions of each image asset.

## 5. Replace Existing Image Tags and Validate Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Replace all standard <img> tags in the codebase with the new OptimizedImage component and validate the implementation.
### Details:
Update all image usages to use the custom component, ensuring props are passed correctly and lazy loading, blur, and responsive features work as intended.
