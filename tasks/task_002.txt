# Task ID: 2
# Title: Navigation Component Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a responsive navigation component that includes links to all main pages and nested links for the Work section.
# Details:
1. Create a `Navigation.jsx` component in the components folder
2. Implement a responsive navigation bar with links to Home, Work, Journal, Shop, and Info pages
3. Add functionality for the Work button to reveal nested links to bodies of work without page navigation
4. Style the navigation to be minimal and clean, matching the overall design aesthetic
5. Implement mobile-responsive behavior (hamburger menu for smaller screens)
6. Add active state styling for current page
7. Example structure:
```jsx
const Navigation = () => {
  const [workExpanded, setWorkExpanded] = useState(false);
  const workBodies = useContext(WorkContext); // Will be implemented later
  
  return (
    <nav className="main-nav">
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <div className="work-nav">
        <button onClick={() => setWorkExpanded(!workExpanded)}>Work</button>
        {workExpanded && (
          <div className="work-subnav">
            {workBodies.map(body => (
              <Link key={body.title} to={`/work/${body.title.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-')}`}>
                {body.title}
              </Link>
            ))}
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
      <Link to="/journal">Journal</Link>
      <Link to="/shop">Shop</Link>
      <Link to="/info">Info</Link>
    </nav>
  );
};
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Test navigation rendering on different screen sizes
2. Verify that clicking the Work button reveals the nested links
3. Ensure all links navigate to the correct routes
4. Test keyboard accessibility
5. Verify that the active page is correctly highlighted

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Navigation Component Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the Navigation.jsx file in the components folder and define the basic structure for the navigation bar.
### Details:
Establish the component file and skeleton, including import statements and a functional component definition.
<info added on 2025-05-03T22:35:55.700Z>
Create a new file called Navigation.jsx in the src/components directory. Import React at the top of the file using the statement `import React from 'react';`. Define a functional component named Navigation using either arrow function or function declaration syntax. Inside the component, return a basic navigation structure using the HTML5 semantic `<nav>` element as a placeholder. This will serve as the foundation for the navigation bar that will later be connected with routing in subtask 2.2. Export the component as default at the end of the file.

## 2. Implement Main Navigation Links with Routing [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Add navigation links to Home, Work, Journal, Shop, and Info pages using React Router's Link component.
### Details:
Use the <Link> component from react-router-dom to create client-side navigation for each main page.
<info added on 2025-05-03T22:36:25.215Z>
Use the <Link> component from react-router-dom to create client-side navigation for each main page.

Implementation plan:
1. Import `NavLink` from `react-router-dom` in `Navigation.jsx` - NavLink is preferred over Link as it provides active state styling.
2. Replace any placeholder content in the Navigation component with a semantic `<ul>` element for better accessibility.
3. Create `<li>` items for each main section (Home, Work, Journal, Shop, Info).
4. Within each list item, implement `<NavLink>` components pointing to the correct routes:
   - Home: "/"
   - Work: "/work"
   - Journal: "/journal"
   - Shop: "/shop"
   - Info: "/info"
5. Add appropriate styling classes to maintain design consistency.
6. Ensure proper aria attributes for accessibility.

## 3. Add Nested Work Section with Expand/Collapse Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Implement a button for the Work section that toggles the display of nested links to bodies of work, without navigating away from the current page.
### Details:
Use React state to control the expanded/collapsed state and map over workBodies to render nested links.
<info added on 2025-05-03T22:36:52.939Z>
Use React state to control the expanded/collapsed state and map over workBodies to render nested links.

Implementation steps:
1. Import `useState` hook from React in the `Navigation.jsx` component
2. Create a new state variable `isWorkExpanded` initialized to `false` to track the expanded/collapsed state
3. Modify the 'Work' list item to replace the NavLink with a container wrapper
4. Add a button labeled 'Work' inside this wrapper that toggles the `isWorkExpanded` state when clicked
5. Create a conditional rendering structure that displays a nested div/ul containing work links only when `isWorkExpanded` is true
6. Add placeholder NavLink components inside the nested element (e.g., 'Body 1' linking to `/work/body-1`, etc.)
7. Ensure the toggle functionality works without navigating away from the current page

## 5. Implement Active State Styling for Current Page [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Highlight the active navigation link based on the current route to indicate the user's location within the site.
### Details:
Use React Router's hooks or NavLink component to apply active styles to the current page link.

## 6. Apply Desktop Navigation Styles [done]
### Dependencies: 2.3
### Description: Apply basic CSS for the navigation layout, links, and Work dropdown suitable for desktop screens.
### Details:
Create Navigation.module.css. Style the main ul, li items, NavLinks, Work button, and the work-subnav dropdown for a clean desktop appearance. Focus on layout, spacing, and typography.
<info added on 2025-05-03T22:40:01.537Z>
Create Navigation.module.css file in the src/components directory. Implement the following styling:

1. Style the main navigation ul as a flex row container with list-style-type: none to remove bullet points
2. Add appropriate spacing between navigation items using margin or padding
3. Style the NavLink components with proper padding, remove text decoration (no underline), and set appropriate font styles
4. Style the 'Work' button to visually match other navigation links while maintaining button functionality
5. Position the .work-subnav dropdown using absolute positioning relative to its parent
6. Add basic styling for the subnav links including background color, padding, and hover states
7. Import the CSS module in Navigation.jsx and apply the appropriate class names to each element

Focus on creating a clean, professional desktop navigation appearance with consistent spacing, typography, and visual hierarchy. Ensure the Work dropdown appears and functions correctly.

<info added on 2025-05-03T22:44:12.092Z>
Create Navigation.module.css. Style the main ul, li items, NavLinks, Work button, and the work-subnav dropdown for a clean desktop appearance. Focus on layout, spacing, and typography.

Update the navigation layout to use a vertical stack instead of horizontal:

1. Modify the main navigation ul (.navList) to use flex-direction: column instead of row
2. Adjust spacing between navigation items to work better in a vertical layout (increase vertical margins, reduce horizontal margins)
3. Update the positioning of the .work-subnav dropdown to appear to the right of the Work button instead of below it
4. Set position: relative on the parent li containing the Work button
5. Adjust the .work-subnav absolute positioning with left: 100% and top: 0 to position it beside the Work button
6. Consider adding a small horizontal offset to prevent overlap between the button and dropdown
7. Ensure all hover states and active states still function properly with the new layout
8. Test the vertical navigation at various viewport widths to ensure proper display

This change will transform the navigation from a horizontal menu to a vertical sidebar-style navigation while maintaining all functionality.

<info added on 2025-05-03T22:45:20.501Z>
Position the vertical navigation fixed to the top-left corner of the viewport to create a sidebar-style navigation. Make the following changes:

1. In Navigation.module.css:
   - Add `.navContainer` selector with `position: fixed`, `top: 0`, `left: 0`, and `height: 100vh`
   - Set an appropriate width for the navigation (e.g., 250px)
   - Add a background color to visually separate the navigation from the main content
   - Consider adding a subtle box-shadow or border-right for depth
   - Ensure z-index is appropriate to keep navigation above other content

2. Create Layout.module.css:
   - Add styles for the main content container
   - Apply left padding or margin equal to the navigation width to prevent content overlap
   - Ensure the main content takes up the remaining viewport width

3. Update Layout.jsx:
   - Import the new Layout.module.css
   - Apply the appropriate class names to the main content container
   - Ensure the navigation component remains outside this container

4. Modify index.css:
   - Remove `display: flex` and `place-items: center` from the body element
   - Update any other global styles that might conflict with the fixed navigation

This approach creates a fixed sidebar navigation that remains visible as users scroll through the page content, with the main content appropriately offset to prevent overlap.

Create Navigation.module.css. Style the main ul, li items, NavLinks, Work button, and the work-subnav dropdown for a clean desktop appearance. Focus on layout, spacing, and typography.

Update the Work dropdown behavior to render inline within the main navigation list instead of using an overlay:

1. Remove the absolute positioning from the `.workSubnav` element
2. Remove the relative positioning from the `.workNavItem` container
3. Make the `.workSubnav` display as a normal block element within the navigation flow
4. Add left padding or margin (approximately 1rem to 1.5rem) to the sub-navigation items to create visual hierarchy through indentation
5. Ensure the sub-navigation items are properly styled to indicate they are child items of the Work section
6. Update any JavaScript toggle functionality to show/hide the subnav while maintaining the layout flow (use display: none/block instead of position changes)
7. Test the navigation at various viewport widths to ensure the inline dropdown displays correctly
8. Verify that the active state styling still works properly with the new inline structure

This change will create a more traditional nested navigation structure where sub-items appear indented beneath their parent item rather than as a floating overlay.

## 7. Implement Tablet Navigation Styles (Media Queries) [done]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Add media queries to adjust navigation styling for tablet screen sizes.
### Details:
In Navigation.module.css, add media queries (e.g., max-width: 1024px) to adjust spacing, font sizes, or layout as needed for typical tablet views. Ensure the Work dropdown still functions correctly.
<info added on 2025-05-03T22:40:39.833Z>
In Navigation.module.css, add media queries (e.g., max-width: 1024px) to adjust spacing, font sizes, or layout as needed for typical tablet views. Ensure the Work dropdown still functions correctly.

Implementation plan:
1. Add a media query block targeting tablet screen sizes: `@media (max-width: 1024px) { ... }`
2. Within this block, reduce the spacing between navigation items by setting `.navList` gap property to 1rem (down from desktop size)
3. Reduce the font size of navigation items by setting `.navItem` font-size to 0.9rem for better fit on tablet screens
4. Test the navigation component at various tablet breakpoints to ensure proper display
5. Verify that the Work dropdown menu still functions and displays correctly at tablet sizes

## 8. Implement Mobile Navigation Styles (Hamburger Menu) [done]
### Dependencies: 2.7
### Description: Implement a hamburger menu for mobile screens.
### Details:
Add state to Navigation.jsx (e.g., isMobileMenuOpen). Add a hamburger button visible only on small screens (e.g., max-width: 768px). Add logic to toggle isMobileMenuOpen. Style the mobile menu (e.g., off-canvas or full-screen overlay) using media queries in Navigation.module.css. Hide the desktop navigation on mobile.
<info added on 2025-05-03T22:41:12.380Z>
Add state to Navigation.jsx (e.g., isMobileMenuOpen). Add a hamburger button visible only on small screens (e.g., max-width: 768px). Add logic to toggle isMobileMenuOpen. Style the mobile menu (e.g., off-canvas or full-screen overlay) using media queries in Navigation.module.css. Hide the desktop navigation on mobile.

Implementation Plan:
1. In Navigation.jsx:
   - Add useState hook to create isMobileMenuOpen state (default to false)
   - Create a hamburger button component with appropriate accessibility attributes
   - Implement onClick handler for the hamburger button to toggle isMobileMenuOpen state
   - Use conditional rendering or CSS classes to hide desktop navigation menu on mobile
   - Create a separate mobile menu component that renders when isMobileMenuOpen is true
   - Include a close button within the mobile menu to toggle state back to false

2. In Navigation.module.css:
   - Create styles for .hamburgerButton (three lines icon or use an SVG)
   - Add media query for mobile screens: @media (max-width: 768px)
   - Inside the media query:
     - Hide the default .navList with display: none
     - Show .hamburgerButton with display: block
     - Style .mobileNavList as an overlay or side panel
     - Add transitions for smooth opening/closing animations
     - Style mobile navigation links (larger touch targets, full width, etc.)
     - Style close button for the mobile menu

## 9. Add Active State Styling for Links [done]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Add styling to indicate the currently active navigation link.
### Details:
Leverage NavLink's 'active' class or a custom function passed to the className prop in Navigation.jsx. Define the active styles (e.g., underline, color change) in Navigation.module.css.
<info added on 2025-05-03T22:42:01.010Z>
Leverage NavLink's 'active' class or a custom function passed to the className prop in Navigation.jsx. Define the active styles (e.g., underline, color change) in Navigation.module.css.

Implementation Plan:
1. Define styles for `.activeLink` in `Navigation.module.css`:
   - Add a distinctive color change (use the primary brand color)
   - Implement an underline or bottom border
   - Consider adding a subtle background color or font weight change
   - Ensure the active state has sufficient contrast for accessibility

2. In `Navigation.jsx`:
   - Verify the `getNavLinkClass` function correctly applies `styles.activeLink` to the active navigation item
   - Ensure the function properly combines the base link class with the active class when a link is active
   - Test the function with different navigation states to confirm proper class application
   - Add comments explaining the active state logic for future maintainability
